\Chapter{Introduction}

The purpose of the package is to find numerically  
local minima of the Lagrangian action restricted 
to the space of symmetric loops, according to the results 
of 
\cite{FT2003} and \cite{zz}.
In order to obtain a good approximation of the symmetric orbits,
two steps  are necessary:
first, given an integer $n\geq 3$ and a dimension $d\geq 2$
one has to list all possible (finite) symmetry groups
for the $n$-body problem in $\R^d$.
Then, it is necessary communicate the data about the symmetry
group to a custom optimization package, that interactively
parses the input and output the supposed minimizer
in data format. At the end, some post-processing is done in
order to visualize an animation of the orbit found
and compute some of its invariants (energy, angular momentum,
and so on).

This package thus consist of two piaces:
first a GAP package that interactively allows to classify
and define symmetry groups; then, an optimization package
performs numerical optimization, via a custom user interface,
allowing interactive manipulation and visualization of 
the orbit, which planar or spatial.

At the end of this short manual we will show a sample
interactive session and list some of the most used commands.
